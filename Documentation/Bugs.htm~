Bugs?  What bugs? There are no bugs.  Those are features. <p><p>

Well, maybe there a few. <p><p>

Known and possible bugs:
<ul>
<li> The autodetection system for the format type for the DSA/11k series scopes is not guaranteed to always work.  I haven't seen it fail, but it might.  Manually set the format type if this is a problem. </li>
<li> The serial port download code (on Windows at least) has had problems.  They went away for reasons that are not clear. </li>
<li> The serial port download code has not been tested on Linux (it should work though)</li>
<li> Recent builds have not had the serial port code tested on Windows </li>
</ul>
