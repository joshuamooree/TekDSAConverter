This is a program for taking screen shots from a Tektronix DSA602 and converting them to standard image formats.  It's based on the WXWidgets library.  The project is setup as a codeblocks project. It's been quite some time since I last compiled it, so no idea if it still compiles.  Should be compilable with mingw.
